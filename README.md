# PythonChallenge

In the work presented here, I created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company based on a set of financial data called budget_data.csv. The dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. I created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
The file file called main.py is the main script used to run each analysis with the folder: PyBank and PyPoll.

The second script was made to help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process by using a set of poll data named election_data.csv

I did so by creating a Python script that analyses the votes and calculates each of the following:

The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote.
For each script I was also able to generate a .txt file on the pathout.
